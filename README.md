# Insurance Cost Prediction

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using machine learning models. It includes two main approaches:

- **Linear Regression** – a classic statistical method
- **MLP Regressor (Neural Network)** – a more flexible deep learning model

Both are trained and evaluated using a dataset of individual demographics and insurance costs.

## 🔍 Highlights

- Data preprocessing (categorical encoding, normalisation, standardisation)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Model training & evaluation (MAE, RMSE, Relative Error)
- Visualisations: distribution plots, scatter plots, and loss curves

---

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Python**
- **pandas**, **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook** / **Google Colab**

---

## 🔮 Results

Models were evaluated based on:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- Relative RMSE (%)
- Loss curves (for MLPRegressor)

The MLP model shows how deep learning can complement traditional regression for predicting continuous values like costs.

## 💡 Purpose

This repo was created for hands-on learning in machine learning regression techniques, model comparison, and data visualisation — all applied to a real-world dataset.
